#' This is a block of comments. It is ALWAYS a great idea to use a lot of 
#'  comments in your code.  The hash-tag + single quote on the left 
#'  will perpetuate itself as you type and add new lines.
#
#  The hash-tag without the single quote will not auto-add a new one
#   for each line, and you have to do it yourself.

# Load in the tidyverse library
library( tidyverse )


# Here is a data set that exists on an external web server.
url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mk1YGH9LqjF7drJE-td1G_JkdADOU0eMlrP01WFBT8s/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv"


# Go look up the function read_csv() (important, the underline version, not the dot version).
#  and load these data in and assign them to a local variable.

read_csv( url ) -> df


# Make a summary of the data and look at the variables.
summary(df)

#' Questions: Answer these questions below using R code to show the proper answer.
#'  There will be additional questions, each with a sequential number, throughout
#'  the rest of this document.
#' 
#' 1. How many variables are there in the dataset?
#' 2. What are the names of the variables?
#' 3. What data types are represented in the raw dataset?
#' 4. How many rows and columns are in this dataset?



#' Processing Date/Time
#' 
#' To process date and time functions, we need to bring in another library.
#' 
#' If you do not have this one installed, please install it.
library( lubridate )


#' The current date and time data is stored in the column `DateTime`
#' 
#' 6. Show the first entry in the data set for DateTime



#' The text format of date+time is locale specific (the US is the only one that
#'  has the month before the day, etc.).   We want to convert this column of data
#'  which is currently "character" into real dates and times.  For this, 
#'  go look up the function `mdy_hms()` (Month - Day - Year + Hour + Minute + Second)
#'  
#'  7. Make a new variable that is a real Date from the DateTime column.


#' 8. Make two new variables derived from the raw data.  One that has air temperature
#'    in Â°C and another that has rain in cm.  Name them appropriately.


#' 9. Create a new data.frame object that has the date, air temperature, and rain in 
#'    as columns.


#' 10. Save this data.frame object to the local drive using the `write_csv()` function.
