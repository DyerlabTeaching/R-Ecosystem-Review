# R Ecosystem Review

## Impetus

This repository has a single 'in class' activity—reviewing the necessary `R` features that all students need.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:  
 - Review all the basic `R` skills necessary for a graduate-level course.

## Content 

This repository only has a single object, one `in class` [Quarto document](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/R-Ecosystem-Review/in-class.html) that reviews the following items that I am assuming incoming students already know with links to resources for review.  The topics include:

- Up to date `R` installation.  
- Recent `RStudio` installation. 
- Understanding of both `R` scripts and `Quarto` document.  
- Some familiarity with `tidyverse` data manipulation.  
- `ggplot2` competencies, and   
- The abilitiy to work with `knitr::kable` and `kableExtra` libraries.
