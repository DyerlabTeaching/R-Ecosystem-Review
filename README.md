![](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/R-Ecosystem-Review/media/GeneratedImage.png)

## Impetus

This repository has a single 'in class' activityâ€”reviewing the necessary `R` features that all students need.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:   

- Review all the basic `R` skills necessary for a graduate-level course.

## Content 

This repository only has the following content:  

1. A [PDF of the slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1psDh8gUGj7mPZiokpAfi5QJmK33T30dF/view?usp=sharing) for the initial class, where we get to know each other and I get a sense of where the class is wrt R and RStudio.  

2. A [PDF of the slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k5cJYrwj-bei4Mc-bw_lBnr93ARbbXrk/view?usp=sharing) for the next day that has a quick overview of the R, RStudio, and basic skills.

3. An `in class` [Quarto document](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/R-Ecosystem-Review/in-class.html) that reviews the following items that I am assuming incoming students already know with links to resources for review.  The topics in this document include:   
    - Up to date `R` installation.  
    - Recent `RStudio` installation. 
    - Understanding of both `R` scripts and `Quarto` document.  
    - Some familiarity with `tidyverse` data manipulation.  
    - `ggplot2` competencies, and   
    - The ability to work with `knitr::kable` and `kableExtra` libraries.
